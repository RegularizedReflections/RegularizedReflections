# Welcome to Regularized Reflections

This is the inaugural post of **Regularized Reflections**, where we apply the principles of machine learning regularization to AI discourse.

## What This Blog Is About

Just as regularization prevents models from overfitting to training data, this blog aims to prevent our thinking from overfitting to the latest AI hype cycles. We'll explore:

- **Technical realities** behind AI developments
- **Societal implications** beyond the headlines  
- **Nuanced analysis** that cuts through noise

## What to Expect

I'll be publishing experimental thoughts, deep dives into AI papers, and reflections on where artificial intelligence intersects with reality. Think of it as applied epistemology for the age of large language models.

## The Meta-Question

Starting a blog about AI discourse while using GitHub Pages and Jekyll feels appropriately recursive. We're using tools built by the same technological ecosystem we'll be analyzing.

That recursive relationship—between the tools we use and the thoughts we think—will likely be a recurring theme here.

*Next up: A deeper dive into why current AI commentary suffers from its own version of overfitting, and how we might regularize our way to better insights.*
